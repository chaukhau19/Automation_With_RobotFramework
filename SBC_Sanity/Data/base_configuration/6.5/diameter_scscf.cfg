#HSS host and realm are only used by a diameter client
#HSS host is optional. if absent, diameter message will be sent to the next diameter node according to HssRealm, then an answer is sent back by a redirect agent including the destination host, after receiving the answer the diameter stack re route the message to the destination host. Such configuration is used when an SLF is present in the network.

#CnxAuto, indicates whether the node will initiate a peer connection when attaching the peer to a peer group used by a realm, or after connecting the peer using a management command (dia_maint).
# CnxAuto = 1 or 0. 1 indicates that the peer is automatically connected.
